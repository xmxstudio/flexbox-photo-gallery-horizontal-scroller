# flexbox-photo-gallery-horizontal-scroller
simple little jquery and flexbox autoscrolling gallery thingy.

it uses css flexboxes to handle each image/title/caption and horizontal layout.

Jquery is used to create an automatic scrolling effect when the mouse is in either the left or right  "gutter". The further in the "gutter" the faster it scrolls. 

If you want velocity added to this let me know and I'll do it.
